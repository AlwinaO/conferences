# Welcome to the Conferences App!

I created this web app for tech conferences because I've attended quite a few conferences since I've been on my coding journey and they all had a different focus/purpose. In the application, a user can sign up/log in and view other conferences added by other users as well as their own. Only a user can edit/delete a conference that they created. A user has many conferences and a conference belongs to a user. 

## Installation instructions

Install the corneal gem. More instructions --> https://github.com/thebrianemory/corneal. This gem was created by a former Flatiron School student built as a Sinatra application generator for future users who needed a simple Sinatra web application. 

## Demo
